# vim-toki-pi-ilo-sona
toki pi ilo sona language support for vim

# installation
If for some reason you're like me and want to code in a language that uses not latin characters and doesn't have a compiler (yet!) to actually run your programs, here's how you can use the _vim-toki-pi-ilo-sona_ plugin:

Firstly, this is a plugin for https://www.vim.org/[Vim] (though I personally use https://neovim.io/[Neovim]). If you have no experience with Vim you're out of luck (unless you learn! Vim is a wonderful tool!).

If you have Vim, you likely already know how to install plugins, there are many plugin managers (I use https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug]).

To install it with vim-plug, you simply add the following to your `vimrc` (or `init.vim` if you use Neovim)

  Plug 'timeopochin/vim-toki-pi-ilo-sona'

Then run this inside Vim:

  :PlugInstall
